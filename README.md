# Titanic Passengers
Subject: SDS (Statistics and Data Science) / Descriptive Statistics & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
Name: Abdanur

## 📌 Project Description
This project explores the Titanic passengers dataset using Python.  
The goal is to load the data, check data types and missing values, compute descriptive statistics, create visualizations (histogram, boxplot, and other plots), and explain the results in simple words.

Dataset used:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv

## 💡 Features
- Load and inspect the dataset (head/tail, shape)
- Show column names, data types, and missing values
- Classify variables (categorical vs numerical; discrete vs continuous)
- Calculate descriptive statistics for numerical columns:
  - mean, median, standard deviation, variance, min, max
- Create readable plots with titles and axis labels:
  - histogram
  - boxplot
  - one extra plot (example: scatter plot)
- Write short interpretations and observations based on the results

## 📦 Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for plots)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MnstrsParago/SDS.DescriptiveStats.TitanicPassengers.git
   cd SDS.DescriptiveStats.TitanicPassengers
   ```

2. Open and run the notebook:
   - `SDS.Abdanur.ipynb`

3. Make sure you have the libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
   ```

## 📘 Reflection
This project helped me practice a basic statistics workflow: understanding a dataset, working with missing values, summarizing numerical columns, and using plots to see distributions and possible outliers.  
It also improved my ability to describe results clearly using simple explanations.
